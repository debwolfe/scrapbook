A place to store quotations of code I like

## The great questions have come before us
Let's gather an assembly of mighty bits. Mostly, I'm looking for single ruby files that demonstrate a single concept admirably.

### Care and Feeding
1. Remember to get a clone down to where you are working into Desktop/scrabook so you can add files daily from wherever you are working.
2. Cut and paste the file but list the source in a comment
3. Push the repo up with a commit by day with comments to include the concepts we were working on
4. File names should reflect the concept we were trying to get across first with the name of the excercise second ie. recursion_sudoku.rb
5. Delete the folder from the local machine when you are out.
6. Thank all the people who have come before us
7. Ask your pairs to be patient with this collection obsession--it's all the rage and you should start one too.
